# Keylogger 

> ⚠️ This project is intended **only for ethical hacking education** and **cybersecurity awareness**. It does **not** send data over the internet and is **safe to run locally**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This Python-based Keylogger Simulator demonstrates how basic keylogging tools work by capturing keyboard input locally. It helps cybersecurity students and ethical hackers understand the mechanics behind keyloggers in a legal and controlled environment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Captures all keystrokes with timestamps
- ✅ Automatically writes logs to `logs/key_log.txt`
- ✅ Terminates safely when the `ESC` key is pressed
- ✅ Uses threading to flush logs every 60 seconds
- ✅ 100% offline – does **not** send data anywhere
- ✅ Beginner-friendly and well-documented code

## 🧠 Why This Project?
Keyloggers are common in both offensive and defensive security:

🛡️ Blue teams learn how to detect them

🕵️ Red teams learn how they’re made (ethically)

🧑‍🎓 Students understand keyboard event listeners

This simulator helps bridge the knowledge gap safely.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer
